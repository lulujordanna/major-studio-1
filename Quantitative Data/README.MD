With this sketch I wanted to explore the relationship between [The Modern & Contemporary Art](https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/curatorial-departments/modern-and-contemporary-art) department and the media of work it represents. This idea was sparked during our class discussion on â€œExploring museum collections online: Some background reading" by John Stack. A strong theme that arose during our discussion was how can museums adopt and integrate New Media into their digital collections? (Ex. Video, VR and Installation Art).

With this in mind, I created a bubble chart looking at the 96 form of media represented in this department. I categorized them into 7 bins to groups their relationships (Ceramics | Sculpture, Drawing | Prints, Household Objects, Metal | Acrylic | Wood, Miscellaneous, Paintings, Textiles | Costumes). The scale of the bubble is proportional to the number of objects in each sub-category. What I found interesting about this exercise was while the The Modern & Contemporary Art department is large it doesn't have any representation of New Media that I was looking for.

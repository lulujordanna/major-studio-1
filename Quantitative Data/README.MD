## Quantitative Data 

### Ideation

With this sketch I wanted to explore the relationship between [The Modern & Contemporary Art](https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/curatorial-departments/modern-and-contemporary-art) department and the media of work it represents. This idea was sparked during our class discussion on [â€œExploring museum collections online: Some background reading"](https://lab.sciencemuseum.org.uk/exploring-museum-collections-online-some-background-reading-da5a332fa2f8) by John Stack. A strong theme that arose during our discussion was how can museums adopt and integrate New Media into their digital collections? (Ex. Video, VR and Installation Art).

With this in mind, I created a bubble chart looking at the 96 form of media represented in this department. I categorized them into 7 bins to groups their relationships (Ceramics | Sculpture, Drawing | Prints, Household Objects, Metal | Acrylic | Wood, Miscellaneous, Paintings, Textiles | Costumes). The scale of the bubble is proportional to the number of objects in each sub-category. What I found interesting about this exercise was while the The Modern & Contemporary Art department is large it doesn't have any representation of New Media that I was looking for.

### Final Outcome

While not initally successful to find New Media Art, exhibited in my ideation drawing, I was directed to The Met's [Time-Based Media Group.](https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/conservation-and-scientific-research/time-based-media-working-group) Using this as my dataset, I worked with the CSV file to anyalse the collection for my quantative visualization.

*&#xa9; Guerrilla Girls*

30 years since the inception of The Guerrilla Girls infamous poster, I began to question how has The Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met) progressed? Are female nudes still predominantly on display? Since 1989, is The Met collecting more contemporary female artists? Through this data visualization, I explore these guiding questions and pay homage to The Guerrilla Girls who paved this path.

The data visualization explores artist gender and the subjectivity of female nudes. It draws on qualitative and quantitative practices to highlight a narrative shaped by The Guerrilla Girls. The visualization was built through HTML, CSS, and D3.js and uses data from The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Digital Collection Open Access and Clare Churchouse. The total sample size for the nude comparative analysis is 2011 objects and for the Modern Art acquisitions is 5035 objects. All photos in Github are public domain images provided through The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Digital Collection Open Access. Below is a selection of images of the project but you can view the full webpage [here](https://lulujordanna.github.io/major-studio-1/interactive/).

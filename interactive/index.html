        <p>30 years since the inception of The Guerrilla Girls infamous poster, <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/guerrilla-girls-do-women-have-to-be-naked-to-get-into-the-met-museum-p78793", target="blank">"Do Women Have To Be Naked To Get Into The Met Museum?"</a>, I began to question how has The Metropolitan Museum progressed? Are female nudes still predominately on display? Since 1989, is The Met collecting more female artists? Through this data visualization, I explore the guiding questions and pay homage to The Guerrilla Girls who paved this path. </p>

        <p class="insight">Less that <span style="color:#b43175;">14%</span> of the <span style="color:#b43175;">artists</span> in the Modern Art Collection are women, but <span style="color:#b43175;">60%</span> of the <span style="color:#b43175;">nudes</span> are female.</p>

        <p>The graph above compares the solo male and female nudes in the Met&apos;s collection. In Solo female nudes represent 60% of the collection, while solo male nudes represent 28% of the collection. Nudes with both genders represent 11% of the collection but were excluding in this comparative analysis. When the bar graph is rescaled, the largest decade for collecting female nudes in the 1980s (258 artifacts), followed by the 2000s (158 artifacts) after The Guerilla Girls, "Do Women Have To Be Naked To Get Into The Met Museum?" was created. With this inequal balance in the nude collection, are female nudes predominantly on display? Below is a curated selection of the female nudes of display to highlight the proportion. </p>

        <p>The graph above breaks down the artist&apos;s gender of new acquisitions in the Modern Art Collection since 1989. Exploring the data, in the past 30 years the acquisitions have skewed towards male artists. The most objects by female artists were collected in 2009 (35 objects), when the collection acquired 11 pieces from the textile artist, Doris Tillett. </p>

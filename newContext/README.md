## New Context 
The goal of this final unit is to bring data into a new context, either in physical space or mobile space. 

### Ideation
For the final assignment, I have two directions in which I would like to explore and will narrow my parameters down based on feedback from both my professors and classmates. 

#### Physical Space 
Being inspired by Neil Oilver's [project](https://neil-oliver.github.io/Major-Studio-1/Interactivity/), I thought about how objects are connected within departments at The Met. I would like to create a small multiples laser cut diagrams which showcase the connections between objects. Focusing on the tag 'Women' to narrow down the parameters, each object would be connected to a start and end date to create a network diagram. I want these diagrams to become a generate art peice that reflects the links within the department. The image below is an example of what renders for the European Painting department.

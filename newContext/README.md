## New Context 
The goal of this final unit is to bring data into a new context, either in physical space or mobile space. 

### Ideation
For the final assignment, I have two directions in which I would like to explore and will narrow my parameters down based on feedback from both my professors and classmates. 

#### Physical Space 
Being inspired by Neil Oilver's [project](https://neil-oliver.github.io/Major-Studio-1/Interactivity/), I thought about how objects are connected within departments at The Met. I would like to create a small multiples, laser cut diagrams which showcase the connections between objects. Focusing on the tag 'Women' to narrow down the parameters, each object would be connected to a start and end date to build a network diagram. I want these diagrams to become a generative art peice that reflects the links within the department. The image below is an example of what renders for the European Painting department.

#### Mobile Space 
Building off my interactive project [Undress for The Met](https://lulujordanna.github.io/major-studio-1/interactive/), making the project response for mobile requires some adjustments to the layout but also provides an opportunity think of new applications. Instead of having the grid of images on mobile, there could be an option to learn about the works in different context. If you're at home, it would be directed to The Met's website but if you were in the space, if could be an AR application using the rear camera.

## Qualitative Data 

### Ideation 
For the qualitative assignment, I wanted to explore the Costume Institute's collection to build a colour analysis of the dresses in the collection, based on years they were created. I thought this would be a unique way to visualize the collection and highlight trends in colour over time. Below is an hand-drawn sketch of this original concept.

### Final Outcome
Based on feedback from classmates, I moved forward with exploring the costumes institues collection but focused on the themes of the MET gala as a way to source my data. My final outcome is a colour analysis of the past five years themes of the Costume Institutes exhbition. I wanted to explore how the objects within the show would impact the visual language of the exhibition. The visualization was built in HTML, CSS and D3. The images below are screenshots from outcome or you can find the full visualization here.

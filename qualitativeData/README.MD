## Qualitative Data 

### Ideation 
For the qualitative assignment, I wanted to explore the Costume Institute's collection to build a colour analysis of the dresses in the collection, based on years they were created. I thought this would be a unique way to visualize the collection and highlight trends in colour over time. Below is an hand-drawn sketch of this original concept.

### Final Outcome
Based on feedback from classmates, I moved forward with exploring the Costume Institute's collection but focused on the themes of the MET gala as a way to source my data. My final outcome is a colour analysis of the past five years themes of the fashion exhibition. 

The visualization was built in HTML, CSS, Vibrant JS and D3. The data was parsed from The Metropolitan Museum of Arts website based on past exhibitions. The total sample size is 30 objects to build a qualitative comparison. All images used in the visualization been credited to the owners/photographers.The images below are screenshots from outcome or you can find the full visualization [here](https://lulujordanna.github.io/major-studio-1/qualitativeData/).

## Quantitative Data 

### Ideation

With this sketch I wanted to explore the relationship between [The Modern & Contemporary Art](https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/curatorial-departments/modern-and-contemporary-art) department and the media of work it represents. This idea was sparked during our class discussion on [â€œExploring museum collections online: Some background reading"](https://lab.sciencemuseum.org.uk/exploring-museum-collections-online-some-background-reading-da5a332fa2f8) by John Stack. A strong theme that arose during our discussion was how can museums adopt and integrate New Media into their digital collections? (Ex. Video, VR and Installation Art).

With this in mind, I created a bubble chart looking at the 96 form of media represented in this department. I categorized them into 7 bins to groups their relationships (Ceramics | Sculpture, Drawing | Prints, Household Objects, Metal | Acrylic | Wood, Miscellaneous, Paintings, Textiles | Costumes). The scale of the bubble is proportional to the number of objects in each sub-category. What I found interesting about this exercise was while the The Modern & Contemporary Art department is large it doesn't have any representation of New Media that I was looking for.





### Final Outcome

While not initially successful to find New Media Art, exhibited in my ideation drawing, I was directed to The Met's [Time-Based Media Group.](https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/conservation-and-scientific-research/time-based-media-working-group) Using this as my dataset, I worked with the CSV file to analyze the collection for my quantitative visualization. I added additional data (Acquisition Date, Artist Gender, Object Media and Nationality) to the CSV file. Below you can find an image file of the visualization and my code for the webpage and assets are located in this folder of my Github.

        <h1>What is New Media</h1>
            <div>
                <p>New media art refers to artworks that enable digital or interactive processes. This genre can include video art, computer graphics, animation, interactive art, internet art and 3D printing. Art Historian Edward Shanken writes in <i>Contemporary Art and New Media: Digital Divide or Hybrid Discourse?</i>, 'New media art often involves interaction between artist and observer or between observers and the artwork...[this does] not distinguish new media art but rather serve as a common ground that has parallels in other strands of contemporary art practice.'</p>

        <h1>Is there New Media Art at The Met?</h1>
            <div>
                <p>The Met is a pivotal example of a legacy museum. The collection is vast and encompasses some of the most fundamental pieces of art and artifacts. However, the negative connotations of legacy can suggest traditional standards or practices, which might not suggest the new nuisances of contemporary art. This led to my questioning; has The Met adopted new media art? What types of new media art do they collect? What is the makeup of this collection? </p>
                <p>While initially not successful in my search on the API and website, I was pointed to The Time-Based Media Group. Directly from their website, The Met states that 'Time-based media art encompasses works that include film, video, audio, or digital technologies that unfold to viewers over a period of time. Since the early 2000s, The Met has assembled significant holdings in time-based media art, with acquisitions of these works having tripled over the last five years. As of 2017, The Met collection comprises over 250 works of time-based media art.'</p>

            <h1>What is the makeup of New Media Art?</h1>
            <p>While the collection of new media art is small in comparison, the dataset holds fascinating stories and complexities within it. Looking at the media type all new media artwork that The Met collects, involves video in some capacity. The largest category of media type is digital video that has been transferred from a film video. When exploring the date of production most of these examples were made between 1970-2000, highlighting early video art.</p>  
            <p>TThe artist background also shed interesting light on the collection itself. While William Wegman is the largest artist based on number of works in the collection, the makeup of the collection is very diverse with 83% of artists having 1 piece of work. There is a fairly close gender balance between the artists, and they represent 14 different countries.</p>
